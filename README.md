# Basketball Rule Violation Detection

This is a project for basketball rules violation recognition that I did for my bachelor thesis. 

### How to install and run the app: ###

1) Install conda
2) cd into program folder 
3) Enter "conda env create" to create an environment from environment.yml
4) Enter "conda activate pytorch1" to activate the environment that was created
5) Add videos to program/vids folder, reference them in the code of app file you want to use
6) Run "python ViolationDetectionApp.py" to execute the main program


### How to run the tests: ###
1) After completing installation steps, run "python TestSuite.py". Might need to change the assertions according to which videos you're testing.
